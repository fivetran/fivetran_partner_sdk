# Glossary of Approved Terms

Fivetran provides this glossary of approved terms as a resource for SDK connector partners.

This glossary is not an extensive list of terms that may be used in the documentation. For any professional term that is not mentioned in this document, default to the industry standard. For general spelling and usage, follow [Merriam-Webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). The Merriam-Webster dictionary is the primary dictionary for the AP Style, which is the backbone of the Fivetran style.

## Approved word list

Use **lets** instead of **allows**; it’s shorter and saves a word.

* RIGHT: lets you connect
* WRONG: allows you to connect

**alternately** has multiple meanings; use **alternatively** instead.

* RIGHT: You can do X. Alternatively, you can do Y.
* WRONG: You can do X. Alternately, you can do Y.

Use **denylist**, not **blacklist**.

**boolean** does not need to be capitalized

**change data capture** and **change tracking** (SQL Server database's incremental update mechanisms) should not be capitalized

**change history tracking (CHT)** for anything [change history tracking](https://fivetran.com/docs/using-fivetran/features#history)\-related

**checkbox**, *not* check box or tick box. When you describe how to interact with a checkbox, use **select**, *not* check, and **clear**, *not* un-check.

**drop-down menu**, *not* dropdown.

**either** can be used for more than 2 items. **Example**: Table names will be in *either* the COMPLETE, IN\_PROGRESS, or NOT\_STARTED state, depending on their sync status.

**false** Lowercase unless part of a code block, then uppercase or sentence case depending on the language (for SQL keywords and key pairs, always use uppercase). Format as code when written as text. For example, "set the column value to `false`."

**Fivetran dashboard**, *no*t Fivetran Dashboard. Also, **Your Fivetran dashboard**, *not* The Fivetran dashboard. Also, **In your Fivetran dashboard**, *not* On your Fivetran dashboard.

**full sync** \- don't use. Use **historical sync** instead.

**integration** \- don't use. In the common context of connector, use **connector** instead.

**log in** and **login**:

* **Log in**: when it is an action. **Example**: *Log in* to your website.
* **Login**: When it is a thing or a modifier using an adjective. **Example**: Go to the *login* page.

**log in to**, *not* log into

**make a note of** a field, *not* copy or save. **Example**: Make a note of the API key. You will need it to configure Fivetran.

**monthly active rows** spell out in lower case the first time it's used on a page. Follow with the acronym if it will be used multiple times. **Example:** In this document, you will learn how *monthly active rows (MAR)* are calculated, how to track your *MAR*, and how to optimize your usage.

**More Options menu**, *not* three vertical dots or right menu

**master** (as in master database) don't use. Use **primary** instead.

**slave** (as in slave database) don't use. Use **replica** instead.

**SQL** Use with “a,” not “an.” While there is some debate as to whether it should be pronounced “sequel” or “ess-que-el,” “sequel” is the more common pronunciation and is the one we use internally.

**sync** use in the sense of “syncing a connector”; avoid using in other ways to preserve that meaning; *do not* use **update** in its place

**via** Don’t use it. Use the appropriate English word instead (for example, “by” or “through"). Via is vague and thus potentially confusing.

**warning** Capitalize when it refers to a Warning alert generated in the Fivetran dashboard. For example, "Dismiss the Warning on the Alerts page."

**whitelist** Don't use. Use **safelist** instead. See also [Writing inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation).
